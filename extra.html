    <h3>Group Assignment Tool</h3>
    <p>
      My first research work at Thayer involved development of the <a href = "https://journeys.dartmouth.edu/groupassignmenttool/">Group Assignment Tool</a>.

      Additional details are available on the linked webpage, but in short the Group Assignment Tool allows professors to assign students to class groups
      based on student survey data, optimizing for things like diversity, heterogeneity of previous experience, and leadership styles.

    <h3>C Programming with Linux</h3>
    
    <p>
      My current research engagement, which is currently winding up, involves backend development for Thayer's new online
      <a href="https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/dartmouth-imtx-c-programming-with-linux">professional certificate in C and Linux</a>.

      I helped with course development, activity creation and implementation, and automated checkers to validate student code and provide helpful feedback to encourage student learning.
